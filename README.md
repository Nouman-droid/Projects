# My Web Development Projects

This repo contains small web projects I built while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The goal is to practice coding and understand how web development works.

## Projects
- Netflix Clone (HTML, CSS)
- Morse Code Translator (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Other mini-projects for practice

## Notes
- Some code logic is inspired by tutorials or ChatGPT.
- All code was typed and implemented by me for learning purposes.
- Projects are for learning and personal practice, not commercial use.

## Live Demos
